# Active Work Coordination

**Purpose**: Prevent concurrent edit conflicts between Claude sessions (or between you and Claude).
**Rule**: Check this file at session start. Claim your scope before working. Clear it when done.

---

## How to Use

**Before starting work:**
1. Read this file
2. Check if anything is already claimed that overlaps your intended work
3. Add your claim below with name, date, and scope
4. If there's a conflict, resolve it before proceeding

**When done:**
1. Remove your claim from the table
2. If you left anything mid-way, note it in the Unresolved section below

## Currently Active

| Operator | Started | Scope | Files at risk |
|----------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Caio + Claude | 2026-08-11 | Landing page rebuild (live-preview cards) for custom-domain launch | `index.html`, `README.md` |
> Cleared 2026-08-12: the warehouse funnel shipped (`53891ed`). Its `sankey.html` change was
> an additive third `SK.mode` branch plus one header link; the ICP and identified-traffic
> branches were re-verified unregressed (conservation + rendered labels) before pushing.
> Note for any session regenerating data: `build_data_lakehouse.py` now requires
> `LAKEHOUSE_WAREHOUSE_ID` in the environment — the compute id is deliberately not committed.
> Note for the landing-page session: `explorations/journey-markov/` shipped 2026-08-12 and is
> live but not yet linked from the landing page — add its card when rebuilding.

> Resolved 2026-08-11: the unclaimed `dots-friend-enemy` changes were the V2.4 influences work
> (wandering attractor + predator). Committed by that session. The miss was real — it edited a
> shared-workspace file without filing a claim row first, which is exactly what left the fireflies
> session guessing. Claim before writing, even when you expect to be the only one working.

## Unresolved (mid-flight work from interrupted sessions)

*Nothing currently unresolved.*

> Resolved 2026-08-12: the sankey v1.5 NOTES/SESSION_LOG entries were written by the
> graph-spacing session that held those files (NOTES bumped to 1.5.0, §"The funnel view"
> extended, SESSION_LOG "v1.5" entry covers both pages).
